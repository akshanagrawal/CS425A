In this, refer the code attached for more details. It is C++ code and run on any C++ compiler.
Basic outline: The code is verified for different sample inputs and then addressed the questions asked. 
Note, if the error is detected by CRC method then the data word is discarded else accepted (for methodology refer the code).
Also, if CRC remainder is zero wrt to the pattern for the encoded data received we say that the error are not detected/not there, else non zero remainder/CRC means dataword is discarded.
Precisely speaking, given a k-bit block of bits, or message, the transmitter generates an sequence, known as a frame check sequence (FCS), such that the resulting frame, consisting of n bits,
is exactly divisible by some predetermined number. The receiver then divides the incoming frame by that number and, if there is no remainder, assumes there was no error.

Note the output of code is:

Following are four sample inputs

P is 110101, D is 1010001101
The Encoded data is: 101000110101110 with 5 last digits as CRC: 01110

P is 1010, D is 1010101010
The Encoded data is: 1010101010100 with 3 last digits as CRC: 100

P is 1011, D is 1010101010
The Encoded data is: 1010101010101 with 3 last digits as CRC: 101

P is 1000, D is 1010101011
The Encoded data is: 1010101011000 with 3 last digits as CRC: 000

Part a-d begins from here:

Random message of 10-bits is: 0001110111
Encoded messsage for pattern P = 110101 is: 000111011110001 having last 5 digits as CRC: 10001
Received erroneous 15 bit message: 100111110011111
The message contains error and need re-transmission as the CRC at receiever end is: 10110, which is, non-zero and dataword is discarded.
Now, error free 15 bit codeword message received on re-transmission: 000111011110001 as CRC obtained at receiver side is: 00000
So, 10 bit dataword accepted on re-transmission is: 0001110111
